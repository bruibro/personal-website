I am a PhD student at the [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and I am conducting my research in the Communication Systems Department at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Elia](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/elia-petros).

In 2017, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/). In 2019, thanks to the [TOP-UIC](https://didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/ingegneria_civile/en/top_uic) double degree program, I received both the Master's Degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino and the Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/), where I completed my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Daniela Tuninetti](https://nicest.lab.uic.edu/profiles/tuninetti-daniela/) and [Prof. Natasha Devroye](https://devroye.lab.uic.edu/).

During the PhD I decided to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and data science following the courses given by the [Data Science Department](https://ds.eurecom.fr/) at EURECOM. Hence, I received in 2021 the Master of Science in Data Science and Engineering co-accredited by the [Institute Mines-Télécom (IMT)](https://www.imt.fr/en/).

Currently, my research interests include information and communication theory, coding theory and machine learning, but I am also interested in digital communications, digital signal processing, image and video processing.

I am a passionate [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) user and a digital typography enthusiast. I play the piano and lately I am discovering trekking. I excitedly follow the [Formula 1 Championship](https://www.formula1.com/).
